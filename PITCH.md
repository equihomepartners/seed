# Equihome Investment Opportunity - Confidential

## [HERO SECTION]
Hi everyone, I'm Sujay Namburi, co-founder of Equihome. Thank you all for being here today. We're pioneering a new approach to home equity investments in Australia. We're bringing institutional capital to homeowners in a way that's quite unique in Australia, and today I'm excited to share how we're solving a critical financial challenge for homeowners while creating essentially a new asset class for our global clients.

Now quickly, as we've gotten initial sizable commitments for our fund, and we're now raising $5M in operational capital to position ourselves for a launch towards the end of Q2 2025. But before we dive into the numbers, let me share why this opportunity is so unique and why the timing couldn't be better.

You see, we've developed a way for homeowners to access their equity without taking on more debt - no monthly payments, complete flexibility, and all powered by our proprietary AI technology. This isn't just another fintech play; this is about transforming how Australians access and use their home equity.

## [VISION SECTION]
Let me walk you through our vision for transforming home equity access in Australia.

## [THE STORY]
Imagine being a homeowner in Sydney - consistently ranked among the most expensive housing markets globally, where the median home price is over $1.3M. This isn't just luxury housing; this is what an average family home costs here. So we have this unique situation where everyday Australians are sitting on millions in home equity, yet they're struggling with the highest mortgage payments they've ever faced, rising living costs, and inflation.

This is the reality for millions of Australian homeowners today. They're technically millionaires on paper - we're talking about a $5.5T market - but they're facing a massive affordability crisis. They can't access their equity without taking on even more debt and monthly payments, which is the last thing they need in today's high-interest environment.

This problem became crystal clear to us when we saw homeowners increasingly trapped between two  choices: either stay cash-poor despite being asset-rich, or take on additional debt in an already challenging interest rate environment - this includes of course 2nd mortgages, credit card debt, personal loans, and other forms of debt.

## [CURRENT OPTIONS]
Here's what makes this opportunity unique - Australia's property market operates quite differently from the US. While Americans enjoy 30-year fixed mortgages, Australians face variable rates. This creates a perfect storm:

- Rising rates are squeezing homeowners
- Traditional equity access means more monthly payments
- Current solutions are failing those who need them most

Think about it - HELOCs, second mortgages, reverse mortgages - they all add to the monthly burden. And in today's environment, that's exactly what homeowners can't afford. Tie that with homeowners having worse and worse credit profiles for the banks and you have a situation where the banks are squeezing homeowners even further.

## [SOLUTION SECTION]
We've developed something fundamentally different. Instead of lending money, we partner with homeowners. The key features of our product are beautifully simple:
- No monthly payments and a simple fixed interest rate of 5% that's capitalized to the exit of the homeowner
- We share in the home's appreciation
- Homeowners can exit anytime within 10 years
- Fast processing for the loans we want to put out as we leverage our in-house AI technology for underwriting (under 21 days)

## [AUSTRALIAN MARKET SECTION]
The Australian market - specifically Sydney has extremely strong market fundamentals geared for this product and business model:
- Rock-solid economy (AAA-rated)
- Unmatched stability (32+ years of growth)
- Sydney's has consistently outperformed the rest of Australia and the majority of the world's major metro areas for the last 30 years when it comes to growth
These three major factors combined create a very risk averse market environment that is very conducive to to our business goals and allow us to really niche down on the right type of homeowners, suburbs, and assets we want to work with. 

## [BUSINESS MODEL SECTION]
Equihome operates as both a Fund Manager and a traditional Fintech company. 

1. **The Fund ($500M)**
On the fund side of the business, our global clients are sophisticated institutional investors who are looking to be exposed to the Australian property market in a game breaking way - they are able to participate in premium Australian residential real estate without having to directly own properties along with incur costly taxes such as stamp duty. The money we raise from these investors is deployed as loans to homeowners. 

2. **The Operations ($5M Raise)**
On the operational front of the business, we generate revenue from the loans we put out to homeowners along with of course the fees we charge our clients for managing the fund. Our current round is a raise directly into this side of the business. As traditional founders and fund managers, we are positioning the operational entity for investors to realize VC-like returns through an exit event. The drivers for performance are our technology and data aggregation, ability to capture market share, and of course performance of our portfolio.

## [WIN-WIN MODEL SECTION]
What makes this special is how everyone benefits:
- Homeowners get financial flexibility without more debt
- Fund investors get premium property exposure in a renown market
- Operational investors get to participate in a proven model in a massive market

## [GROWTH TRAJECTORY SECTION]
Let me walk you through where we are and where we're headed:

**What We've Achieved:**
- Secured $500M in fund commitments from sovereign wealth funds
- Built our core AI-driven underwriting engine
- Completed regulatory framework and legal structure
- Established key banking and valuation partnerships

**Where We Are Now:**
- Final stages of technology development
- Raising $5M operational capital
- Building out our initial team
- Setting up our first office in Sydney

**Launch Timeline:**
- Q1 2024: Complete operational raise
- Q2 2024: First office opens in Sydney CBD
- Q3 2024: Initial $50M deployment in premium Sydney suburbs
- Q4 2024: Expand to broader Sydney metro area
- 2025: Scale to $500M AUM
- 2026-2027: Target $2B+ AUM

We're starting strategically in Sydney's premium market ($2M-3M homes) where we see the strongest demand and lowest risk. Our technology platform is built to scale, and as we prove out the model in Sydney, we'll be well-positioned to expand to other major Australian cities.
